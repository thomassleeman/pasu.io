    question: "Who is behind PASU.io?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        PASU is the brainchild of Aaron Hanway and Tom Sleeman, whose friendship
        began some 20 years ago while studying Psychology together at
        University. Through conversations about their own workplace experiences,
        they recognized a pressing need for a greater understanding of burnout â€“
        its causes, effects, and potential treatments. This realization sparked
        the idea for an online platform where individuals could access
        comprehensive information on the topic, and thus, PASU was born. <br />
        <br />
        Aaron, a counselor and psychotherapist based in Wicklow, Ireland, brings
        a wealth of personal and professional experience to PASU. He specializes
        in helping individuals from all walks of life who are grappling with
        burnout, a passion fueled by his own struggles in a previous career.
        Before transitioning to therapy, Aaron worked in the social care sector,
        where he faced significant burnout firsthand. This transformative
        experience ultimately led him to pursue a career as a therapist,
        dedicated to supporting others facing similar challenges. To learn more
        about Aaron&apos;s journey with burnout, be sure to explore the Burnout
        Stories section.

        Tom is a software engineer and small business owner based in Surrey,
        England. Having spent a number of years working on various projects and
        businesses - some successful and others not - Tom knows only too well
        the pressures of self-imposed goals and the importance of being aware of
        the signs of burnout.
